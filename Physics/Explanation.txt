(43) is the mass ratio between the Muon and the electron. (43.7.1) Weinberg angle, (43.8) W+ / Tau mass ratio. + for space-like P(Myu) where U(Myu) is null, (43.12) Tau/Muon mass ratio. (43.17)-(43.17.2) (like (43.12) is based on (43.10),(43.11)) is the inverse Fine Structure Constant. (43.17.3)-(43.17.6) - On the mass gap. (29),(30) - equivalence of charge and gravitational mass. That calss for a breakthrough wrap drive technology, however, -1 Coulombs generates -5.90213 * 10^9 Kg gravitational mass, +Coulombs generates +5.90213 * 10^9 Kg. That means that 1 MV on 1 Meters^ capacitor plates at distance 1 Meters will separat about (-,+)51370 Kg. Not sufficient for an Alcubierre Warp Drive's requirement (-,+)10^27 Kg. So static charge seperation will not yield any measurable thrust. The solutio therefore must use dynamic electric fields as well as high charge separation along an axis an along distance.
